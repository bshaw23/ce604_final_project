\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this project is to make a clear connection between the fields of continuum mechanics and the finite element method. 
The material presented herein is based on Hughes chpt 5.4 and Dr. Shepherd's Timoshenko Frame Derivation.
The motivation for undertaking this project is first and foremost to help myself gain a better understanding of these topics. 
I also hope that my work here will also help to accelerate other students learning as they try to understand the connection between continuum mechanics and the finite element method. 

{\Rd make this different, more like a real paper}
I think it would be helpful to say $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (greek) represent 1 and 2 while $e$ and $i$ (latin) represent 1, 2, and 3
