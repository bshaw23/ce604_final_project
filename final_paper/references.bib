                  Poisson-disk sampling that is both maximal and
                  unbiased over bounded non-convex domains. To our
                  knowledge this is the first provably correct
                  algorithm with time and space dependent only on the
                  number of points produced. Our method has two
                  phases, both based on classical dart-throwing. The
                  first phase uses a background grid of square cells
                  to rapidly create an unbiased, near-maximal covering
                  of the domain. The second phase completes the
                  maximal covering by calculating the connected
                  components of the remaining uncovered voids, and by
                  using their geometry to efficiently place unbiased
                  samples that cover them. The second phase converges
                  quickly, overcoming a common difficulty in
                  dart-throwing methods. The deterministic memory is
                  O(n) and the expected running time is O(n log n),
                  where n is the output size, the number of points in
                  the final sample. Our serial implementation verifies
                  that the log n dependence is minor, and nearly O(n)
                  performance for both time and memory is achieved in
                  practice. We also present a parallel implementation
                  on GPUs to demonstrate the parallel-friendly nature
                  of our method, which achieves 2.4x the performance
                  of our serial version. ",

The robustness and effectiveness of our technique are demonstrated by batch processing an SVG collection of 20k images, and by comparing our results against state of the art linear and curvilinear meshing algorithms. We demonstrate for our algorithm the practical utility of computing diffusion curves, fluid simulations, elastic deformations, and shape inflation on complex 2D geometries.},

                  vertices of a general simplex, followed by the
                  replacement of the vertex with the highest value by

                  minimum. The method is shown to be effective and

                  application areas like machine learning and network
                  analysis in which the key data structures are
                  "irregular" data structures like graphs, trees, and
                  sets. To address the need for better abstractions,
                  we introduce a data-centric formulation of
                  algorithms called the operator formulation in which
                  an algorithm is expressed in terms of its action on
                  data structures. This formulation is the basis for a
                  structural analysis of algorithms that we call
                  tao-analysis. Tao-analysis can be viewed as an
                  abstraction of algorithms that distills out
                  algorithmic properties important for
                  parallelization. It reveals that a generalized form
                  of data-parallelism called amorphous
                  data-parallelism is ubiquitous in algorithms, and
                  that, depending on the tao-structure of the
                  algorithm, this parallelism may be exploited by
                  compile-time, inspector-executor or optimistic
                  parallelization, thereby unifying these seemingly
                  unrelated parallelization techniques. Regular
                  algorithms emerge as a special case of irregular
                  algorithms, and many application-specific
                  optimization techniques can be generalized to a
                  broader context. These results suggest that the
                  operator formulation and tao-analysis of algorithms
                  can be the foundation of a systematic approach to
                  parallel programming.}

                  evaluation tests proposed in the literature and add
                  one with a real workload where dynamic memory
                  allocation is used for building the kd-tree data
                  structure. Following the performance analysis we
                  propose a new dynamic memory allocator and its
                  variants that address the limitations of the
                  existing dynamic memory allocators. The new dynamic
                  memory allocator uses few resources and is targeted
                  towards large and variably sized memory allocations
                  on massively parallel hardware architectures.}

                  led to real advances in the mechanical simulation of
                  organs. However, it is important to notice that,
                  despite the major role they may have in the
                  interaction between organs, the connective tissues
                  are often left out of these simulations. In this
                  paper, we propose a model which can rely on either a
                  mesh based or a meshless methods. To provide a
                  realistic simulation of these tissues, our work is
                  based on the weak form of continuum mechanics
                  equations for hyperelastic soft materials.
                  Furthermore, the stability of deformable objects
                  simulation is ensured by an implicit temporal
                  integration scheme. Our method allows to model these
                  tissues without prior assumption on the dimension of
                  their of their geometry (curve, surface or volume),
                  and enables mechanical coupling between organs. To
                  obtain an interactive frame rate, we develop a
                  parallel version suitable for to GPU computation.
                  Finally we demonstrate the proper convergence of our
                  finite element scheme.}},

  abstract =     {Hard-core Strauss disc processes with inhibition
                  distance r and disc radius R are considered. The
                  points in the Strauss point process are thought of
                  as trees and the discs as crowns. Formulas for the
                  mean and the variance of the vacancy (non-covered
                  area) are derived. This is done both for the case of
                  a fixed number of points and for the case of a
                  random number of points. For tractability, the
                  region is assumed to be a torus or, in one
                  dimension, a circle in which case the discs are
                  segments. In the one-dimensional case, the formulas
                  are exact for all r. This case, although less
                  important in practice than the two-dimensional case,
                  has provided a lot of inspiration. In the
                  two-dimensional case, the formulas are only
                  approximate but rather accurate for r < R. Markov
                  Chain Monte Carlo simulations confirm that they work
                  well. For R ≤ r < 2R, no formulas are presented. A
                  forestry estimation problem, which has motivated the
                  research, is briefly considered as well as another
                  application in spatial statistics.},

  abstract =     {The theory of optimal size meshes gives a method for
                  analyzing the output size (number of simplices) of a
                  Delaunay refinement mesh in terms of the integral of
                  a sizing function over the input domain. The input
                  points define a maximal such sizing function called
                  the feature size. This paper presents a way to bound
                  the feature size integral in terms of an easy to
                  compute property of a suitable ordering of the point
                  set. The key idea is to consider the pacing of an
                  ordered point set, a measure of the rate of change
                  in the feature size as points are added one at a
                  time. In previous work, Miller et al. showed that if
                  an ordered point set has pacing ?, then the number
                  of vertices in an optimal mesh will be O(?dn), where
                  d is the input dimension. We give a new analysis of
                  this integral showing that the output size is only
                  ?(n+nlog?). The new analysis tightens bounds from
                  several previous results and provides matching lower
                  bounds. Moreover, it precisely characterizes inputs
                  that yield outputs of size O(n).}

This new framework aims to extend the conventional DelaunayâVoronoi primal-dual structure; seeking to assemble generalised orthogonal tessellations with enhanced geometric quality. The construction of these grids is motivated by the desire to improve the performance and accuracy of numerical methods based on unstructured co-volume type schemes, including various staggered grid techniques for the simulation of fluid dynamics and hyperbolic transport. In this study, a new hybrid optimisation strategy is proposed; seeking to optimise the geometry, topology and weights associated with general, two-dimensional Regular-Power tessellations using a combination of gradient-ascent and energy-based techniques. The performance of this new method is tested experimentally, with a range of complex, multi-resolution primal-dual grids generated for various coastal and regional ocean modelling applications."

abstract = {Polyhedral meshes are increasingly becoming an attractive option with particular advantages over traditional meshes for certain applications.What has been missing is a robust polyhedral meshing algorithm that can handle broad classes of domains exhibiting arbitrarily curved boundaries and sharp features. In addition, the power of primal-dual mesh pairs, exemplified by Voronoi-Delaunay meshes, has been recognized as an important ingredient in numerous formulations. The VoroCrust algorithm is the first provably correct algorithm for conforming polyhedral Voronoi meshing for non-convex and non-manifold domains with guarantees on the quality of both surface and volume elements. A robust refinement process estimates a suitable sizing field that enables the careful placement of Voronoi seeds across the surface, circumventing the need for clipping and avoiding its many drawbacks. The algorithm has the flexibility of filling the interior by either structured or random samples while preserving all sharp features in the output mesh. We demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm on a variety of models and compare against state-of-the-art polyhedral meshing methods based on clipped Voronoi cells establishing the clear advantage of VoroCrust output.}

               of smooth curves in the plane, such that the Crust family of
               proximity-based reconstruction algorithms can rebuild the
               curves. Reconstruction requires a dense sampling of local
               features, i.e., parts of the curve that are close in
               Euclidean distance but far apart geodesically. We show that
               epsilon<0.47-sampling is sufficient for our proposed
               HNN-CRUST variant, improving upon the  state-of-the-art
               requirement of epsilon<1/3-sampling. Thus we may reconstruct
               curves with many fewer samples. We also present a new
               sampling scheme that reduces the required density even
               further than epsilon<0.47-sampling. We achieve this by
               better controlling the spacing between geodesically
               consecutive points. Our novel sampling condition is based on
               the reach, the minimum local feature size along intervals
               between samples. This is mathematically closer to the
               reconstruction density requirements, particularly near
               sharp-angled features. We prove lower and upper bounds on
               reach rho-sampling density in terms of lfs epsilon-sampling
               and demonstrate that we typically reduce the required number
               of samples for reconstruction by more than half. "

abstract="Compatible discretizations transform partial differential equations to discrete algebraic problems that mimic fundamental properties of the continuum equations. We provide a common framework for mimetic discretizations using algebraic topology to guide our analysis. The framework and all attendant discrete structures are put together by using two basic mappings between differential forms and cochains. The key concept of the framework is a natural inner product on cochains which induces a combinatorial Hodge theory on the cochain complex. The framework supports mutually consistent operations of differentiation and integration, has a combinatorial Stokes theorem, and preserves the invariants of the De Rham cohomology groups. This allows, among other things, for an elementary calculation of the kernel of the discrete Laplacian. Our framework provides an abstraction that includes examples of compatible finite element, finite volume, and finite difference methods. We describe how these methods result from a choice of the reconstruction operator and explain when they are equivalent. We demonstrate how to apply the framework for compatible discretization for two scalar versions of the Hodge Laplacian.",

abstract = {We propose a novel tetrahedral meshing technique that is unconditionally robust, requires no user interaction, and can directly convert a triangle soup into an analysis-ready volumetric mesh. The approach is based on several core principles: (1) initial mesh construction based on a fully robust, yet efficient, filtered exact computation (2) explicit (automatic or user-defined) tolerancing of the mesh relative to the surface input (3) iterative mesh improvement with guarantees, at every step, of the output validity. The quality of the resulting mesh is a direct function of the target mesh size and allowed tolerance: increasing allowed deviation from the initial mesh and decreasing the target edge length both lead to higher mesh quality.Our approach enables "black-box" analysis, i.e. it allows to automatically solve partial differential equations on geometrical models available in the wild, offering a robustness and reliability comparable to, e.g., image processing algorithms, opening the door to automatic, large scale processing of real-world geometric data.},

We compare the different combinations through extensive experimental evaluation and identify optimization techniques that work well in practical situations.

The boundaries of these material regions form non-manifold surfaces. In earlier papers, we developed an octree-based isocontouring method to construct unstructured 3D meshes for a single material (homogeneous) domain with manifold boundary. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a material change edge and use it to identify the interface between two or several different materials. A novel method to calculate the minimizer point for a cell shared by more than two materials is provided, which forms a non-manifold node on the boundary. We then mesh all the material regions simultaneously and automatically while conforming to their boundaries directly from volumetric data. Both material change edges and interior edges are analyzed to construct tetrahedral meshes, and interior grid points are analyzed for proper hexahedral mesh construction. Finally, edge-contraction and smoothing methods are used to improve the quality of tetrahedral meshes, and a combination of pillowing, geometric flow and optimization techniques is used for hexahedral mesh quality improvement. The shrink set of pillowing schemes is defined automatically as the boundary of each material region. Several application results of our multi-material mesh generation method are also provided.}

One or both of the adjacent hexahedral meshes are locally modified to create a one-to-one mapping between between the mesh nodes and quadrilaterals at the interface allowing a conforming mesh to be created. In the finite element method, non-conforming interfaces are currently handled using constraint conditions such as gap-elements, tied contacts, or multi-point constraints. By creating a conforming mesh, the need for constraint conditions is eliminated resulting in a smoother, more precise numerical solution. The method presented in this paper uses hexahedral dual operations, including pillowing, sheet extraction, dicing and column collapse operations, to affect the local mesh modifications. In addition, an extension to pillowing, called sheet inflation, is introduced to handle the insertion of self-intersecting and self-touching sheets. The quality of the resultant conforming hexahedral mesh is high and the increase in number of elements is moderate.",

abstract = {We propose a new tetrahedral meshing method, fTetWild, to convert triangle soups into high-quality tetrahedral meshes. Our method builds on the TetWild algorithm, replacing the rational triangle insertion with a new incremental approach to construct and optimize the output mesh, interleaving triangle insertion and mesh optimization. Our approach makes it possible to maintain a valid floating-point tetrahedral mesh at all algorithmic stages, eliminating the need for costly constructions with rational numbers used by TetWild, while maintaining full robustness and similar output quality. This allows us to improve on TetWild in two ways. First, our algorithm is significantly faster, with running time comparable to less robust Delaunay-based tetrahedralization algorithms. Second, our algorithm is guaranteed to produce a valid tetrahedral mesh with floating-point vertex coordinates, while TetWild produces a valid mesh with rational coordinates which is not guaranteed to be valid after floating-point conversion. As a trade-off, our algorithm no longer guarantees that all input triangles are present in the output mesh, but in practice, as confirmed by our tests on the Thingi10k dataset, the algorithm always succeeds in inserting all input triangles.},
